At all of our social classes, you will rotate between different partners in order to get the chance to dance with new people; even at technique classes, there is nothing prohibiting you from coming alone to hone your individual skills. A partner is needed if and when you decide to compete in national competitions as part of our teams. However, there is definitely no need to bring a partner with you to try out the classes – bring a friend along instead for some extra fun!</p><p>If you are an experienced ballroom or latin dancer looking for a partner, the best place to come is the <strong>Main Team trials</strong> at the start of the year. If you missed it, just come to one of the technique classes – you will find other people of similar level to yours at these classes. However, to be part of the Main Team and attend the additional Main Team practices, you will need to have a partner.</p><p>There is no need to have a fixed partner to join the Salsa and Bachata Team regardless of level, unless you are selected to be in a formation dance; in this case, a partner will be assigned to you by our instructor during training.</p><h2 id="where-does-it-take-place%3F" tabindex="-1">Where does it take place?</h2><p>All Classes take place in the Junior Common Room (<strong>JCR</strong>) in the Sherfield building.</p><p>(Note that without membership you will only be able to attend scheduled lessons and won’t be able to use these as practice spaces.)</p><p><strong>JCR</strong>: The Junior Common Room is number 20 on the <a href="https://www.imperial.ac.uk/media/imperial-college/faculty-of-engineering/civil/public/about/sthkencampus.pdf">South Kensington campus map</a>; the entrance is opposite number 15.
