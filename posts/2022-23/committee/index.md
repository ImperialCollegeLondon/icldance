### What do you love about the club?

> The openness and support from the community is my personal stand-out. Not sure if it's just the character traits of the people who decide to start to dance or whether the hobby and music itself generates the great vibes. Much love to every member of this dance family.

## Vice Team Captain (B&L Comps)
