It’s the last day of term, what’s a better celebration than recapping the amazing socials that we’ve held this term? 🔥

What was your favourite moment? Was it meeting new buddies at the freshers’ or winning the best costume at Halloween or demoing a two-man cha at Christmas?
My personal favourite was the selfie of our VP social Marcos and DJ Casper 👻
