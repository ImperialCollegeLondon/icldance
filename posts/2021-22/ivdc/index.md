The Inter Varsity Dance Competition 2022 took place on 26/02/22 in Blackpool’s Winter Gardens. 71 members of the IC Dance Club competed on Saturday and each and every one of them should be proud of their achievements!!

Congratulations to everyone who competed at the competition; you were all assets to the team and we couldn’t have done it without your skill and team spirit throughout the day! Every member of the team made Blackpool really enjoyable this year, so thank you all!!! Shout out as well to those who came along as spectators in support of the Dance Club!

Thanks also goes to Bowen, Sophia, Izabela and Madison who organised the coach, hotel, competition entries and admin so brilliantly. Without them, literally none of us would have been there!

Last, but by no means least, huge thanks goes to our coaches, Laura, Damiano and Marika. They go above and beyond with their guidance, support and coaching and we can never thank them enough!

Every ICDC competitor deserves a well-earned rest now!!!
