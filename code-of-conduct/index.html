It recognises that its publications, online, print, and social media are important tools in recruiting new members and engaging with alumni and potential sponsors. It is the responsibility of all ICDC members to manage their personal social media presence responsibly.

However, we will expect you to renounce from representing your original society at competitions while you are taking classes at Imperial in favour of representing Imperial instead, even if the competition regulations would only allow you to do so to a lesser extent than if you were to represent your original society.</p><h2 id="breaches-of-the-code-of-conduct" tabindex="-1">Breaches of the Code of Conduct</h2><p>Breaches of the Code of Conduct will be dealt with informally by the Team Captain in the first instance.</p><p>Should a serious breach or repeated breaches of the Code of Conduct be identified, the Team Captain, in consultation with the Dance Club President, may suspend a member from Team activities pending further investigation. If deemed a serious breach of the code, it will be escalated to the Union.</p><p>In the event that they are no longer permitted to be part of the Team, they are required to return all equipment, documents and finances belonging to the Club within 7 days. They will not be entitled to any full or partial refund of annual subscriptions.</p><p>If the excluded or suspended member wishes to appeal the decision, that appeal should be made to the President. An appeal as to the process of exclusion, but not a further investigation into the facts, may be lodged with the Union.</p><h2 id="welfare" tabindex="-1">Welfare</h2><p>ICDC takes the welfare of its members seriously.
