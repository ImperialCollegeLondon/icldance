The dance style is traditionally partnered, but is ‘back-to-front’, with the girl dancing with her back pressed against the man, although the widespread popularity of the music has led to a huge variety of dance styles: choreographed group routines (what we will be teaching) to general ‘club’ dancing.</p></main><footer>© 2025 Imperial College Dance Club</footer><script defer src="https://static.cloudflareinsights.com/beacon.min.js" data-cf-beacon="{&quot;token&quot;: &quot;728dc144c924450c8df445d9e61e350e&quot;}"></script></body></html>
