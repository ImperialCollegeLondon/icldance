The Dance Club distributed a survey to its members to elicit their perspectives on how practices, competitions, trainers, and other elements were organized and executed.</p><p>The report synthesizes member responses to key questions, highlighting recurrent themes in their praise, criticisms and suggestions. Each section addresses feedback pertaining to a specific aspect of the Club’s activities.</p><h2 id="ballroom-practices" tabindex="-1">Ballroom Practices</h2><p>Overall, members find the ballroom practices useful, especially when there is clear structure and focus areas provided. Some feel it becomes too much like an additional technique class at times. Common suggestions were for teachers to provide more individual feedback to couples and set specific improvement tasks to work on before the next session. Members praised the energy and attention to relevant aspects. However, more discipline is needed in terms of punctuality. The space limitations mean dividing into smaller groups is beneficial. But inactive members should still participate in exercises when not dancing, rather than just observing passively.</p><h3 id="takeaways%3A" tabindex="-1">Takeaways:</h3><ul><li>Continue providing structured practices with clear focus areas</li><li>Teachers should give more individual feedback and improvement prompts to each couple</li><li>Enforce punctuality and keep groups engaged even when not dancing their heat</li></ul><h2 id="latin-practices" tabindex="-1">Latin Practices</h2><p>Similar feedback for the Latin practices - members find it useful when there are specific focus areas for each session. There is a desire for teachers to share feedback and attention more evenly amongst couples, rather than just the top dancers constantly. Peer feedback sessions were highlighted as being particularly valuable. Timing late at night was challenging for some members’ energy levels and travel. As with ballroom, more individualized feedback prompts would be appreciated to give couples improvement goals to work towards each practice.</p><h3 id="takeaways%3A-1" tabindex="-1">Takeaways:</h3><ul><li>Maintain practices with defined focus areas</li><li>Distribute teacher attention and feedback evenly to all couples</li><li>Incorporate periodic peer feedback sessions</li><li>Consider earlier timing to optimize energy levels</li></ul><h2 id="feedback-on-trainer-sessions" tabindex="-1">Feedback on Trainer Sessions</h2><p>The trainer sessions are seen as beneficial for getting beginners dancing more and facilitating mingling between teams. However, communication and organization of the sessions needs significant improvement - more notice is required, along with earlier scheduling and assignment of trainers. Clarification is needed regarding the intended outcomes - general tips versus detailed technique advice. There is skepticism about abilities of some trainers. Potential ideas include trainer-mentor schemes and limiting advice to easy presentation/posture improvements.</p><h3 id="takeaways%3A-2" tabindex="-1">Takeaways:</h3><ul><li>Continue trainer sessions for exposure between teams</li><li>Enhance organization - communicate earlier, schedule efficiently, assign trainers</li><li>Clarify intended scope of trainer advice to beginners</li><li>Carefully vet trainers’ abilities if offering technical guidance</li></ul><h2 id="practice-spaces" tabindex="-1">Practice Spaces</h2><p>The JCR space is deemed sufficient by most but very tight for ballroom sessions. Everyone should help with setup and not just arrive once ready. The space should be fully utilised during sessions by respecting lessons occurring and giving them a wide berth. Many members unsurprisingly desire more space, with some specifically requesting alternate studios or Ethos.</p><h3 id="takeaways%3A-3" tabindex="-1">Takeaways:</h3><ul><li>JCR space functions reasonably for current needs</li><li>Enforce common courtesy - assist with setup, respect ongoing lessons</li><li>Explore options for additional space if expansion needed</li></ul><h2 id="competitions---what-members-liked" tabindex="-1">Competitions - what members liked</h2><p>Members praised the positive team atmosphere, supportive and helpful conduct between members, and the prompt coach arrival. Good preparation of beginner dancers was noticed. The new venue was favourably viewed. Disliked aspects included crowded changing areas, inefficient food storage creating mess, and poor timekeeping - arriving very early and departing late at night.</p><h3 id="takeaways%3A-4" tabindex="-1">Takeaways:</h3><ul><li>Maintain terrific team morale and supportiveness between members</li><li>Continue thorough preparation of beginner dancers</li><li>Enforce tidiness and proper food storage/disposal</li><li>Aim for more efficient timing of arrival and departure</li></ul><h2 id="competitions---what-could-be-improved" tabindex="-1">Competitions - what could be improved</h2><p>Key critiques were around late shoe orders affecting beginners’ preparation and some committee members not fulfilling duties, burdening others. Communication of dates, costs and other logistics further in advance would assist planning. Potential ideas included distributing a competition guide detailing procedures, allowing optional earlier travel for sufficient preparation, and exploring cheaper group accommodation options.</p><h3 id="takeaways%3A-5" tabindex="-1">Takeaways:</h3><ul><li>Plan well in advance and communicate timelines/costs to members early</li><li>Ensure all committee members complete assigned responsibilities</li><li>Distribute a competition guide covering all policies and procedures</li><li>Consider earlier travel day option and group discount accommodation</li></ul></main><footer>© 2025 Imperial College Dance Club</footer></body></html>
