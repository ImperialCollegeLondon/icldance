# Ballroom

## Waltz

This is the first dance that Beginners learn in Ballroom dancing. The Waltz originated in Vienna, Austria in the 18th century and was developed into what is known as the Slow Waltz, or English Waltz; it is a gliding, lilting dance with a characteristic 3/4 time (three beats per bar).

## Quickstep

This fast-paced dance is the second Ballroom dance learned by beginners. It has a powerful swing rhythm and it takes inspiration from the foxtrot and the Charleston. The songs and dress style of Quickstep are reminiscent of American high society from the Roaring 20s.

## Foxtrot

The Foxtrot originated in 1913 from the Vaudeville act of actor Harry Fox. This slow dance has smooth steps that glide around the dancefloor.

## Tango

Ballroom Tango originated from the traditional Argentine Tango but is distinct in its style and technique. It has an air of intensity, sharpness, and contrast of movement. Ballroom Tango is characterised by the staccato movements of the feet and fast switching of head positions.

## Viennese Waltz

The Viennese Waltz developed during the 18th Century in Austria. This parent version of the waltz is faster than the English Waltz, but there is a smaller set of steps. Couples glide and rotate around the dancefloor to the characteristic three beat rhythm.

# Latin

## Cha-Cha-Cha

This is the first Latin dance learned by beginners. The name, ‘Cha-Cha-Cha, is in reference to the sound of the dancers’ feet shuffling through syncopations in the music. It is a lively and flirtatious dance, designed to put a smile on everyone’s face!

## Jive

Jive is the second Latin dance learned by beginners. The most noticeable aspects of the Jive, is the energy, speed, and bounce. It is one of the fastest dances and showcases lots of kicks, flicks, and spins. This rhythmical and swinging dance is influenced by the Boogie, Rock ‘n’ Roll, and the Swing.

## Samba

This is mainly inspired by the traditional Brazilian Samba and Ballroom Samba. It contains elements of many different Latin American dances incorporated into one. It makes use of complex cross-rhythms with lots of hip action and a characteristic ‘Samba Bounce’ that charges this dance with an infectious energy.

## Rumba

The Rumba relies on the age-old premise of the lady trying to conquer the man by means of her womanly charms. Incorporating all the elements of teasing and withdrawal, it is considered the most sensual of the Latin dances. It is a slow-paced dance with great emphasis on emotion and the connection between partners.

## Paso Doble

The Paso Doble originated from Spain, and is modelled after the drama and movement of a Spanish bullfight. The man takes the role of the matador, displaying machismo and strength; the woman’s role in the dance is often that of a gypsy flamenco dancer, or following the matador’s movements like his cape. It is almost always choreographed to the famous Gypsy music “España cañí”.

# Salsa, Bachata, and Reggaeton

## Salsa

Salsa is one of the most popular social dances in the world, with diverse influences and origins, particularly from traditional Cuban dances. You can find nightclubs and bars in almost any city around the world where people come to dance Salsa. The music can vary wildly in feeling, from fast-paced, bombastic brass numbers to more reserved and emotive songs. It is a fun, lively, passionate dance that gives you an almost irresistible urge to move your body!

## Bachata

Originating from the Dominican Republic, this beautiful dance has gained great popularity around the world and is now one of the most prominent social dances. The music is slower and generally more expressive than salsa, often making use of more traditional percussion and Spanish guitars. The traditional form of the dance makes use of strong partner connection, fast footwork, and lots of musicality, while the modern form, known as Sensual Bachata, uses body isolations, head rolls, and body rolls with a more intimate connection; both styles are taught at the Dance Club.

## Reggaeton

Reggaeton is a relatively recent style of dance, originating from Puerto Rico in the late 1980s to early 1990s. The music combines elements of Rap and Reggae music (hence the name) with Hip Hop and Latin rhythms. Starting as an underground, rebellious music, Reggaetón resonated with the youth throughout Latin American countries until, as its popularity increased, it began to spread across the world; now, its fiery rhythms can be found in almost any club around the world. The dance style is traditionally partnered, but is ‘back-to-front’, with the girl dancing with her back pressed against the man, although the widespread popularity of the music has led to a huge variety of dance styles: choreographed group routines (what we will be teaching) to general ‘club’ dancing.
