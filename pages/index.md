Join the [Ballroom & Latin Team](/ballroom-and-latin-team/) and dance alongside the [winners of the Inter Varsity Dance Championships 2023 Team Match](/posts/2021-22/ivdc/) 🏆 Taught by [world-class coaches](/instructors/), unleash your inner dancer and burn the floor at a variety of university competitions ✨

Into something more social? Join the UK’s top student [Salsa & Bachata Team](/salsa-and-bachata/)!
