# Welcome to Imperial College Dance Club

![IVDC 2023](/images/ivdc23.jpg)

The Imperial Dance Club has a rich history of over 50 years of nurturing dancers of all abilities, encouraging all to achieve excellence; it doesn’t matter if you were born to dance or born with _two left feet_, Imperial’s Dance Club will guide you to achieve your best!

We provide lessons covering 12 distinct dance styles on a regular basis, with occasional taster sessions offering a glimpse into other styles. We have some of the world’s best instructors who, through their expertise, propel both beginners and experienced dancers along their dancing journey, whilst still maintaining a fun and relaxed atmosphere that all can enjoy. Whether you are looking to compete or to enjoy social dancing, we have you covered.

Being the biggest student-run club in Imperial with the most numbers of alumni members, we have a large, diverse, and welcoming family that continues to embrace new beginners to our team every year. 

There's much more to explore on our website - check out our [Ballroom and Latin Team](/ballroom-and-latin-team/), [Salsa and Bachata Team](/salsa-and-bachata-team/), [Instructors](/instructors/) and [FAQ](/faq/) pages to learn more.
