You will not necessarily need everything on this checklist (especially
if you are a leader) but it is hopefully as complete as possible.

## Food

  - At least two meals-worth of food that is rich in complex
    carbohydrates. e.g. sandwiches/rolls/pasta
  - Instant snacks e.g. chocolate, snacks, fruit
  - Energy drinks, to be saved for the latter half of the day
  - Water (at least two litres\! some places do not have water
    fountains, or they are far away)

## Bathroom

### Hair

  - Hair gel
  - Hair spray
  - Hair comb/brush
  - Elastic hair ties
  - Pins (flat ones/pins for the bun)
  - Hair net (and spares as they have a habit of splitting)
  - Hair dryer
  - Hair accessories (flowers/ornaments/things to make your hair bun
    look bigger)
  - Curling tongs
  - Hair comb

### Make-up (everyone)

  - Make-up brushes/sponges
  - Fake tan instant/cream
  - Make-up remover and cotton
  - Moisturiser
  - Deodorant

### Make-up (girls)

  - Foundation
  - Bronzer/DHA powder + cream
  - Concealer
  - Blusher
  - Eyeliner and eye shadow (white + brown or black, or sparkly)
  - Mascara, false eye-lashes & glue
  - Hand-held mirror
  - Lipstick and lip liner (red or pink; to match the dress colour)
  - Nail polish (for both fingers and toes; same colour as your
    lipstick)

### For when it goes wrong

  - Paracetamol / pain-killer
  - Ankle/knee supports
  - Deep heat rub

## Clothes

  - Jogging suit (or something to pull over when you are not dancing
    that will keep you warm)
  - ***Dance shoes*** (cleaned\!)
  - Shoe brush and oil
  - Heel protectors for the girls
  - Your team match costume, including
      - Dress and accessories e.g. jewellery
      - Tail suit: jacket, trousers, shirt, studs, braces, bow-tie,
        collar, cufflinks
      - Latin trousers
      - Latin top
  - Pants/shorts/socks the same colour as your trousers – girls you
    don’t want to flash anyone if your skirt spins out and boys, just
    in case your trousers split (\!\! this has happened \!\!) and you
    don’t want to keep flashing bare ankles or colourful socks.
  - Shoes to wear when you are not in your dance shoes (comfy, i.e.
    house shoes)

## Miscellaneous

  - Student ID card
  - Smartphone, and optionally a camera
  - Cash (often there are no cash machines around)
  - Safety pins – for pinning numbers and costume fixes
