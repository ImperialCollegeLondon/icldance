# Costume Cleaning Instructions

## Washing

  - Hand wash only. Do not machine wash costumes as this will damage
    them.
  - Wash costumes in a sink or bathtub, depending on size.
  - For large ballroom dresses, wash only the leotard portion.
  - Use cool or cold water. Warm water can discolour the glue holding
    the rhinestones.
  - Use a **gentle hand wash/delicate detergent**, only a small amount
    is needed.
  - Focus cleaning on areas with the most sweat and dirt build-up, like
    the inside of the costume.
  - Gently swirl and rub the costume to clean. Be gentle, **do not**
    wring, twist, stretch or pull the fabric.
  - Before draining wash water, collect any rhinestones that have fallen
    off.
  - Rinse thoroughly with cool water until water runs clear.
  - **Do not get the feathers wet\!**
  - Take care not to tangle the fringe.

## Drying

  - Air dry only. Do not machine dry costumes as this will damage
    fabrics.
  - **Do not** wring, twist, stretch or pull the fabric when removing
    water. Handle garments gently.
  - Gently scrunch fabrics to remove excess moisture.
  - Lay costume flat on towels to partially dry until no longer soaking,
    just damp.
  - Hang up costume to finish air drying. Ensure dress does not stretch
    out of shape while drying.
  - Replace any rhinestones that fell off during washing once costume is
    fully dry.
  - **Do not iron costumes\!**

## End of Year Care

  - Dry clean tail suits before returning them to the costume wardrobe.
  - All borrowed costumes must be cleaned before being returned to avoid
    forfeiting your deposit. You will also forfeit your deposit if the
    costume is damaged.
  - Please inform the wardrobe mistress of any repairs needed when
    returning your costume.
