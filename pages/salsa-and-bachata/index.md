# Salsa and Bachata

Our members are a big family - from weekly dance socials to attending
festivals across the country and around the world, we build a strong
bond with each other. We provide a safe, warm and welcoming environment
for new people to join this ever-expanding community, to learn and grow
together and pass on the passion and love that is at core of social
dancing. Make sure to join us at various social events around London,
boat parties, picnics, festivals and more, or even suggest your own,
where there’s music, you’ll find us dancing.

## Social Classes

Our amazing instructors deliver three
hours of social dancing classes every Monday (Salsa) and Friday
(Bachata). From **6.15** to **9.15pm**, one hour each of beginner, intermediate and
advanced level classes provide excellent technique and musicality
training. 

A perfect opportunity to start from scratch and build a solid
foundation, as well as improve and polish your skills by learning the
challenging routines and how to apply and integrate them into social
dancing. Above all, it's a friendly and welcoming community to meet new
people and just have fun.

- All social classes take place in the JCR. There's no need to bring a
  partner or to sign up in advance.
- Please arrive on the hour for class to start at quarter past
  (i.e. arrive at 6pm for 6.15pm beginners' class) — this gives us time to
  sign you in.

## Teams

We have a range of teams from our non-auditioned Open Level team to our
Advanced Salsa & Bachata teams, which means that there is something for
you no matter your level of experience. Each team learns a group dance,
choreographed by our amazing coaches which we then perform
throughout the year at university competitions, venues around London and
sometimes even abroad.

You can join the open level team and sign up for the salsa and bachata team auditions by completing the form [here](https://linktr.ee/imperialdance).

### Open Level Team

Your chance to experience team choreography and performance, and
continue developing the skills you have learned in social classes\! A
commitment of 1 hour every Sunday to learn from our talented instructor
and practice with the team – no auditions and beginners are welcome. A
fantastic experience to perform, go to inter-university competitions and
join a close-knit, fun and friendly dancing community.

### Salsa & Bachata Team

Our Salsa & Bachata teams each have eight couples selected at an
audition. These teams train for 1.5 hours with our coach every Sunday
and have a 1 hour team practice during the week in term time. Being part
of these teams is a wonderful opportunity to improve your technique and
performance whilst having fun with a group of friendly and enthusiastic
dancers. In addition to this we have an amazing track record at
competitions having won Birmingham Dance Club Latino’s Competition 7
times in the last 8 years. Members of this team tend to have some prior
dancing experience whether that be salsa, bachata or another style.
